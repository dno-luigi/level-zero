**Level Zero: Accessible AI for Everyone**  
*A new way to learn. What will your origin story be?*

Every legend begins with an origin story. What will yours be? Level Zero is here to provide a powerful, adaptable introduction to AI, prioritizing accessibility and affordability. Unlike expensive subscription services, Level Zero offers a free and open-source alternative, empowering anyone to learn about and utilize AI LLMs without financial barriers.

**Why Level Zero?**
We believe AI cannot replace humans, but those who fail to embrace it may be left behind. Level Zero ensures everyone has the opportunity to adapt and thrive.

### **Project Status: Alpha — Focused on UI & Multi-LLM Development**
Level Zero is currently in the alpha stage, with a strong emphasis on creating a user-friendly interface, seamless voice interactions, and support for multiple LLMs. Here’s what we’ve achieved so far:

- **Core UI Functionality**: A clean, intuitive interface with voice input and output capabilities.
- **Free Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech**: Built using the WebKit Speech API, eliminating the need for paid subscriptions.
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Already integrates with multiple LLMs from various APIs.

Our roadmap focuses on expanding memory capabilities, enhancing accessibility, and refining the user experience while keeping everything free and open-source.

### **Our Journey: From a Single File to a Sophisticated AI**
The project began as a simple `index.html` file and has grown into a robust application through collaborative effort. Key milestones include:

- **Initial Concept**: A basic chatbot with text-based input and output.
- **Interface Redesign**: A voice-first interface with a modern, clean design.
- **Free STT/TTS Integration**: Removing the need for paid services.
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Allowing users to explore different AI models.
